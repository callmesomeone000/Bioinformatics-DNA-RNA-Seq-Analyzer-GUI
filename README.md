# 🧬 DNA/RNA Sequence Analyzer with Tkinter GUI

**DNA/RNA Sequence Analyzer** is a Python tool for students and beginners to explore DNA and RNA sequences interactively. It calculates GC content, finds motifs, generates complementary strands, transcribes DNA to RNA, and can plot GC% for multiple sequences—all in a simple GUI.
